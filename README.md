## About The Game

**Minimalist Tower Defence** is an action-packed take on the classic tower defense genre. Instead of just watching from above, you control a hero on the battlefield. Place a deadly maze of towers to weaken the enemy horde, then leap into the fray yourself to finish them off!

Every kill earns you gold to build and expand your defenses. Survive against increasingly difficult waves that spawn from multiple locations, and defend your castle for as long as you can!

## Key Features
